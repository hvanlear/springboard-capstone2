For the villains - in the scraping process, make a reference of all titles/handles with coresponding ID's.
This could be gathered after the inital input of all book/shorts data, just get back all the handles and id's

When the scraped data comes back -
if the villain has a matching handle then create a new pair that can be input into the reference table route

This could also be done for the Types
